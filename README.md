HubSpot Chat Translator - Privacy Policy
Last updated: [6-22-2025]

The HubSpot Chat Translator Chrome Extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

What We Do:
Translates visible chat content and agent replies in the HubSpot interface using a secure proxy server.

Stores user preferences (like target language) locally via Chrome's storage.sync.

What We Don't Do:
No personal information is collected or stored.

No analytics, tracking, or advertising.

No chat content is saved or transmitted outside of the immediate translation request.

If you have any concerns or questions, please contact the developer.
